This repository contains all the codes and launch files for the final capstone project for AuE8230 Autonomy Sciences & Systems<br /> 
The world that was setup for the project demanded the robot to avoid obstacles, follow a line, stop by detecting the stop sign and finally follow an AprilTag; all autonomously.

The methodology employed by our team as follows<br />
(1) The obstacles are avoided by considering different sections of the LiDAR scans. Additionally, the robot exhibits three different behaviours based on its distances from obstacles.\
(2) The line following mode is carried out using blob tracking, estimated using a binary image generated by masking a hsv-space image\
(3) The stop detection was carried out by detecting a 8-sided polygon, and the bot was stopped when the area of the polygon detected was greater than a threshold value\
(4) Lastly, the robot switched to AprilTag detection mode once an AprilTag was detected.

Challenges faced:

(i) The Gazebo simulation part of this project was a little less challenging since the blob tracking and stop sign detection weren't a function of the environment illumination. However, one of the obstacles placed in the environment was below the LiDAR 2D-scan and hence not detected. Thus, the LiDAR was physically moved down to solve this issue.
(ii) For the actual implementation the single greatest challenge was the illumination. The hsv values were tuned several times, yet the line following wasn't robust enough.
(iii) The obstacle avoidance part of the script could have been a little more robust had the team gotten more time.
